## About Me
Hi, I'm Mika, a digital marketer.

MBTI fluctuates between ISFJ, INTP, and ISFP.

I have an astonishing drive for things that interest me, but once I take action, it only lasts for three minutes. Most of the time, I suffer from procrastination, where my mind is active but my body doesn't follow suit.

After completing my thesis and finishing the anxiety-inducing defense,  considering the limited availability of online information regarding degree programs for part-time student, I wanted to write a blog to share my experiences with juniors. But despite planning everything I wanted to write in my mind, I have no motivation to write it down. As a result, I didn't start working on it until my juniors were about to graduate.

That's why this website exists.

I am not a programmer and have only a limited understanding of HTML and CSS, but I still attempt to build a blog on my own. This site may have many bugs, so I welcome any experts to kindly provide guidance.ðŸ¥¹
